/*
Package hyphenator provides TeX-style hyphenation for multiple languages.

It was forked from "github.com/AlanQuatermain/go-hyphenator" and "github.com/AlanQuatermain/go-trie" and and modified.
Original code is very outdated (due to heavy language changes) and probably was never tested with non-English dictionaries.
I was not able to use it without fixes and modifications. I have no plans to submit PR (due to the age of original repositories)
or publish fixes separately from this program...

For sanity sake I retained original COPYRIGHT content in a separate file in this directory.
